### Convex Sets

1. [Proving Convexity of a set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Zl9roACuQ)- The video illustrates how to proceed to prove if a given set is convex or not by using it's definition.

2. [Preliminary reading](http://www.math.udel.edu/~angell/ch1.pdf) material to start from University of Delaware's Department of Mathematical Sciences. [Optimization: Convex Sets](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10725-F12/scribes/10725_Lecture3.pdf) is a lecture note on Convex sets and associated concepts by Department of CS, CMU. [Further reading material](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt-F13/scribes/lec4.pdf) based on convex Optimization course repository of CMU's Statistics Department.
