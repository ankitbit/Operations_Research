The company Lumi ere S.A. is dedicated to the manufacture of l amparas. Your manufacturing line contemplatescurrently three models of l amparas: Yaveo, Llum and Argi.
The manufacturing scheme is indicated below:
The assembly line is composed of 5 full-time workers and 15 workers on average day, whose salaries are 15e / hour and 18e / hour respectively. All the staff of this department has a work contract jo. An agreement has been reached with the company committee to provide
Exibility to the form template that it is allowed to hire the personnel of the line of packaging depending on the workload. his
cost is 20 e / hour for a maximum of 200 hours of work contracted per week.
The opening hours are Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the morning and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.
the afternoon. The following table indicates the number of minutes needed to assemble and pack each one
of the products:


The sale price of three models is respectively 150e / unit, 200e / unit and 120e / unit
respectively
1. To raise the problem of Linear Programming that optimizes the weekly production of the company a.
2. Find a basic solution that consists of making 75 l Yapao shelter and 31.25 l amparas Llum
and check that it is the optimal one.
3. Resolve your problem using AMPL. Note that you only need to create the file
data since this problem is a particular case of the second example of the previous session.
4. Write the dual of your problem and find its optimal solution from the previous one.
The information on the solution of the dual is also accessible in AMPL once you have solved your
problem. In Figure 1 you can see how to access the value on the left side of a restriction
(* .body) and the one on its right side (* .lb if it is a type restriction \> "or * .ub if it is a restriction
type \ 6 "). The name of each restriction is directly associated with the value of the dual variable (price
shadow) corresponding.
