### Unconstrained optimization

First Order Necessary Conditions:

General problem of Minimization

***minimize*** $f(x)$
***subject to*** $x$ $\in$ $\Omega$  ..... 1


In an investigation of the general problem (1) we distinguish two kinds of solution points: ***local minimum points*** , and ***global minimum points***.

Thus, in formulating and attacking problem (1) we shall, by the dictates of practicality, usually consider, implicitly, that we are asking for a relative minimum point. If appropriate conditions hold, this will also be a global minimum point.
