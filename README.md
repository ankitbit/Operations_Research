# Operations Research

## Reference courses
I suggest that the course **Optimization Methods for Business Analytics** offered at **Sloan School of Management (MIT)** provides a good background for mastering the skills required. It can be accessed at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-053-optimization-methods-in-management-science-spring-2013/ **Online Calculator for Performing Matrix Calculations** that are required during the coursework can be obtained here: https://matrixcalc.org/en
